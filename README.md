# Measurement-Invariance
R code for conducting simulation and analysis about measurement invariance

## Detecting Violations of Factorial Invariance Using Data-Based Specification Searches A Monte Carlo Study
In this folder, you can find the simulation process conducted by R. Due to to the different software which the author conducted the simulation, you have to read the procedure of the simulation from creating sample to analysis.
