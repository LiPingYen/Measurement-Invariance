### Detecting Violations of Factorial Invariance Using Data-Based Specification Searches A Monte Carlo Study
  In this folder, you can find the simulation process conducted by R. Due to to the different software which the author conducted the simulation, you have to read the procedure of the simulation from creating sample to analysis firstly.
  
  The R script named raw_function contains original function for generating data and analysis including loop function, apply function and function with parallel computing. fin_funtion R script includes the final version of function for the project.
  
  Next, let's talk about condition. Firstly, the all_condition_info R script includes the brief introduction of each simulation condition from generating dataset to conducting CFA.
